# myvim


Run the myvim file on the system to prepare your vim for Python and v programming without any problems.
Some prerequisites may be required for the correct implementation of plugins. For this purpose, you must manually install those items on your system based on the operating system.
This file has been tested on openSUSE Leap 15.5 and openSUSE Leap 15.4 and Fedora 34 and 35.
In Open Suse, the Python version may be a problem for you :)
